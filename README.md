This project is build on React and Node

1. Date ( display today's date as
default) when you move weeks, then you can load weekly before or after
days from today.
2. The swipe buttons (Previous & Next) to load/move weeks
(default current week)
3. Timezone select
Just put any two random timezones(UTC-0 & a different one) and then when
you change the timezone, you will have to display and change all
displayed times.The timezone will be target timezone to be displayed
4. Load weekly working days(from Mon to Fri) and times(from 8AM to 11PM
